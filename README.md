### Documentation and Structure

**Main Subroutine (`main`):**
- Orchestrates the script execution, calling functions in sequence and handling the main workflow.

**Error Handling:**
- Functions use `die` statements with clear error messages to handle potential issues with file operations and command-line arguments.

**Functions:**
- Each function has a clear purpose and is documented with comments to explain its role and inputs.

**Command-Line Argument Parsing:**
- Uses `GetOptions` for parsing command-line arguments (`-i` for input file, `-o` for output file) and validates their presence.

**Usage Function (`usage`):**
- Displays a usage message with an error explanation and terminates the script.

### Test Plan

#### Test Scenarios

- **Basic Functionality:**
  - Provide valid input and output file paths.
  - Verify that the script completes without errors and generates the expected output file.

- **Missing Input File:**
  - Provide a non-existent input file path.
  - Ensure the script outputs an appropriate error message indicating the file could not be opened.

- **Missing Output File:**
  - Provide a valid input file path and a non-existent output file path.
  - Ensure the script outputs an appropriate error message indicating the output file could not be opened.

- **Invalid Command-Line Arguments:**
  - Execute the script with incorrect command-line arguments.
  - Verify that the script outputs an error message with usage instructions.

- **Large CSV File:**
  - Provide a large CSV file as input.
  - Confirm that the script processes the file correctly and efficiently, handling the size without issues.

- **CSV File with Missing Data:**
  - Provide a CSV file where some rows have missing values.
  - Ensure the script correctly handles missing values and processes the file without errors.

### Execution

- Execute each test scenario manually or automate them using a test framework like `Test::More` for Perl.
- For manual testing, run the script with different scenarios and validate the output against expected results.

This structure ensures the script is well-documented, handles errors gracefully, and includes a comprehensive test plan for validation and verification of its functionality. Adjust the test scenarios based on specific requirements and environments as needed.
